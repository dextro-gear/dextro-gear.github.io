          In the steadfast era of futuristic advancements and new innovations
          popping up every second at an exponential rate, traditional crafts and
          practices take a backseat. Gradually declining to the nooks and
          corners of the country, quite a lot of crafts have begun to be
          detached to the people once they were commonly associated and
          cherished with.

          Through this initiative we aim to understand and amplify the beauty
          and necessity of the metalwork which is so prominent in moulding
          historical artefacts and adorning places pan india. From pious
          associations, with temples imagery to the interiors to the relics of
          Ancient India, crafting goods with metals goes a long way back, etched
          deep in shaping the history of India. From commoners to royalty, what
          was once an abundant sight, isnâ€™t anymore.

          Virtually interacting with the artisans of Velachery amidst the
          pandemic, helped us gain a lot of insight on the practices, processes,
          historical connotations of the work they do and also shed light on the
          impact of modernisation on such intricate and devoted crafts of India.
          Tinkering our way through, we gained a deeper understanding of the
          craft, its associated communities, their lives, and the dynamics it
          possesses in the present day.
