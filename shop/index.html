              The flat chisel is typically used for applying detail, smoothing
              surfaces and finished forms. It is usually held at 35-60Â° to the
              surface of stone but like other chisels it can be used in various
              ways, carefully to smooth or more roughly to shape quickly. The
              traces left behind by the flat chisel tend to consist of almost
              smooth sets of parallel straight lines, sometimes barely
              noticeable when the carver has worked particularly carefully.

              The diamond point chisel is used for cleaning out corners or
              difficult places and pulling over centre punch marks wrongly
              placed for drilling. Cold chisels come in a variety of sizes, from
              fine engraving tools that are tapped with very light hammers, to
              massive tools that are driven with sledgehammers. Cold chisels are
              forged to shape and hardened and tempered (to a blue colour) at
              the cutting edge.

              Embossing Hammer is used to dome metal from the inside. The metal
              is stretched from the inside as it is easier to control because
              the shape becomes rigid. The Embossing Hammer also leaves a very
              interesting dimpled texture on flat and slightly domed metal when
              hammering on the outside of a form against a stake. Made of 420
              stainless steel and Padauk wood. This hammer is also used to form
              flutes and form the metal while it is supported by pitch or wax.

              Offset snips permit you to keep your hands safely above the cut
              while cutting directly through the centre of a large sheet.
              Slightly offset blades are better for making long, straight cuts.
              The handles raise the users cutting hand above the metal which
              avoids running your hand into the material.
